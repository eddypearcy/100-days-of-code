# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about curve-fitting of sinewaves using solar panel data and Python.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the fit since it didn't work at first. But I learned that a good initial guess is required to make things work the way they should. I'm happy with the result.

### Day 2: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved a few basic problems in Java on Leetcode to learn about this language.

**Thoughts:** The problem used very big numbers and I struggled a bit with the different types. I ended up trying to use BigInteger but could not get it to work as I wanted. I'll try again tomorrow.

### Day 3: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried JavaScript for the very first time. I went for the p5.js framework because it allows for nice visuals. I created a small app that simulates some particles. Those particles try to stay as far as possible from each other and the end result looks quite funny.

**Thoughts:** I really liked this first approach to JavaScript. However I don't need to be an expert to know that my code is really dirty. I will try to improve that point. I didn't continue the Leetcode challenge today as I said yesterday, but I will get back to it one of those days.

### Day 4: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the problem of day 2. I ended up scrapping all of my code and starting again from 0 because I figured I didn't have to use BigInteger. I just had to apply a smart algorithm that does additions using a carry. This allows me to stick with the int datatype (could even go with a smaller datatype actually, I just need to fit values from 0 to 9 in there). In the end, my algorithm scored in the top 0.5% on Leetcode. Quite proud of it!

**Thoughts:** What happened today goes to show how important it is to always think before starting. There are often smart ways to do things, but they're not always intuitive. Websites such as Leetcode really focus on this kind of problem for which it is easy to get a solution to but harder to get an O(not_so_scary) solution.

### Day 5: May 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Stayed on Leetcode for this fifth day, continued solving algorithmic problems. I solved the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" one. I tried to make my solution as fast as I could.

**Thoughts:** It might seem obvious, but I think it's also easy to forget: start with a solution that works, then make it faster and more efficient. Otherwise it takes too much effort and the programming process gets inefficient.

### Day 6: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got back to p5.js to try some more animations using particles. I did a fire-looking thing, liked it a lot!

**Thoughts:** I heard that p5.js is much slower than some other animation frameworks such as Processing. I might have a look at that at some point.

**Link to work:** No code for now, but here's a tweet of the end result: https://twitter.com/eddy_pearcy/status/1256970749744762881?s=20



### Day 7: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started to solve a Leetcode problem about finding the median of two sorted arrays. Didn't have enough time to finish it, will do that tommorrow. Used Java.

**Thoughts:** -

### Day 8: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the median-related problem of day 7 and started the next one, still on Leetcode. It was about finding the longest substring palindrome in a given string. I once again used Java.

**Thoughts:** Got a really ice solution for the median problem! The solution to the other problem was above averagd but not in the tops. I'm satisfied with the work.
