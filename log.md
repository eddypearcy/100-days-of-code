# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about curve-fitting of sinewaves using solar panel data and Python.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the fit since it didn't work at first. But I learned that a good initial guess is required to make things work the way they should. I'm happy with the result.
